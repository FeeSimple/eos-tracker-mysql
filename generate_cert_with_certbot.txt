0. Create the folder ".well-known" inside "public" or "dist" or "static"

cd public
mkdir -p .well-known/acme-challenge

1. Stop the Express web server if running and also ensure nothing is listening at port 80

2. sudo apt-get install letsencrypt

3. Generate SSL certificate

Note:
During certification generation or renewal, the Express web server will be challenged and thus it needs
to be running at the default port 80. Must ensure that at port 80, no port forwarding happens.
Otherwise, the challenge for SSL certificate will be failed.

// Always use "certonly"
certbot certonly --webroot -w ./public -d www.feesimplewallet.io -d feesimplewallet.io
